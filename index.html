    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Daryll Litton Christian, a passionate and driven Mobile Application Developer currently pursuing my studies in the Mobile Application Development (MAPD) program. I am deeply interested in technology and software development, especially in creating intuitive, user-friendly mobile applications that solve real-world problems.

      My educational journey has provided me with solid knowledge in a wide range of technologies, tools, and programming languages. Alongside my academic work, I have built and contributed to various projects that have helped me refine my skills in both mobile app development and backend services. I am particularly drawn to the creative side of development, where design meets functionality, and I aim to develop solutions that are not only effective but also visually appealing and easy to use.</p>
      <p>As I move forward in my studies and career, my goal is to develop applications that have a meaningful impact on people’s lives, whether it's in health, education, or everyday convenience. I am particularly interested in building apps that combine AI and cloud technologies to offer personalized and smarter solutions for users. I aim to continue growing my skills in mobile development and eventually explore AI-driven applications that can automate tasks and improve user experience.</p>
